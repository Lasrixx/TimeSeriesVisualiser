# TimeSeriesVisualiser
This project takes the number of visits to freecodecamp.org and visualises them in time order.



This project was created for the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course.



Here is an example of a graph created using Matplotlib. It shows the daily visits to freecodecamp.org over 3 years.

Perhaps a better way of displaying the same data: a box plot created usnig Seaborn. On the left, you can see how the popularity of FreeCodeCamp has increased steadily between 2016 and 2019. On the right, it shows how popularity fluctuates from month to month.
